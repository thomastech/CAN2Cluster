# CAN2Cluster 
Welcome to the CAN2Cluster project. It is an Arduino based CAN-Bus system for controlling Automotive Dashboard Instrument Clusters. The developed version directly interfaces with a 2007-2009 Ford Mustang (six gauge) instrument cluster. Adaption to other CAN-Bus controlled dashboards should be possible by end-user development of the Arduino firmware.

### Notes & Comments
CAN2Cluster is a interactive desktop display that is best described as a car lover's art piece. It uses a Ford Mustang instrument cluster that has a two channel CAN-Bus communication port for control. Low cost Arduino hardware with CAN-Bus is used to animate the instrument cluster's gauges and warning lights.  

There's some interesting features too. An MP3 Audio Player is used to create the sounds of a revving V8 motor that is synced to the dashboard's gauges and indicator lights.

For realism, an automobile ignition key is used to "start" the engine. There's also a hand-held IR remote that can control a dozen different functions. Plus serial terminal host access allows the user to manually control the gauges and indicators.

The Arduino code could be adapted for a variety of applications. For example:
- Automobile Instrument Cluster Tester.
- Animated dashboard display for education, art, or entertainment.
- Dashboard for Race Gaming Cockpit.
